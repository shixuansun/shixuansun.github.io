Shixuan Sun is currently a Research Fellow at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by [Dr. Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/).
His research interests are in database systems, graph algorithms, and parallel computing. Current focus is on acceleration for graph queries, and graph-based fraud detection.

He received his Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2020,
supervised by [Dr. Qiong Luo](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~luo/). Prior to that, he got his M.S and B.S. in Computer Sciences from the School of Software Engineering,
Tongji University in 2014 and 2011 respectively. He worked as a Software Development Engineer at Microsoft (Shanghai) from 2014 to 2015.
